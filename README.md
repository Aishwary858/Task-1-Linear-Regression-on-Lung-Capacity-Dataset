# 🧠 ML Task 1: Lung Capacity Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains **Task 1** of a Machine Learning project series: building and evaluating a **Linear Regression model** to predict lung capacity based on personal and health-related attributes.

---

## 🎯 Task Objective
To understand and implement **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** techniques on a real-world dataset. The goal is to predict lung capacity using independent features such as age, height, gender, and smoking status.

---

## 📚 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following features:
- `Age`: Age of the individual (years)
- `Height`: Height in cm
- `Gender`: Male/Female
- `Smoke`: Yes/No
- `LungCap`: Measured lung capacity (target variable)

---

## 🧪 Workflow Summary
- Data loading and inspection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding (e.g., converting categorical to numerical)
- Building a Linear Regression model
- Model evaluation using:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
  - R² Score

---

## ⚙️ Tools and Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Model Performance
The regression model was evaluated using standard metrics and produced reasonably accurate results. Error metrics like RMSE and MAPE were used to quantify performance.
